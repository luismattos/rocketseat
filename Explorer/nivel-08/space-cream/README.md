# Land 08 - English

Hello dev! How are you? ðŸ“¢

We've already learned that it's important to put English on the learning track to write good code that can be read by other professionals around the world. How about refactoring the code you've already written, translating comments and terms to English?

# ðŸ’» About the challenge

Go back to the **"Grid with Animations"** challenge from Stage 03 and refactor your code, translating comments and class and id names to English whenever possible.

After completing the refactoring, upload the code to your GitHub profile, updating the project.

ðŸ“… Submission

You must submit this challenge by sending the link to the GitHub repository with the translated code. **Remember to write a good [README.md](http://README.md) in English about the project!**

**The extra mile:** How about also updating your GitHub profile's [README.md](http://README.md) and writing it in English? This part will not be delivered, but you can share your profile with the community and on LinkedIn! If you want, tag Rocketseat!
